## 📝 Additional Suggestions

1. **Add more datasets from spreadsheet?** The spreadsheet contains many audio datasets (ASVspoof, WaveFake, MLAAD) - should these be included in detail?

2. **Add tool implementations?** The spreadsheet lists detection tools (SHAP, Grad-CAM, etc.) - should these be added?

3. **Add benchmark comparisons?** Should we add more detailed performance comparison tables?

4. **Create dataset download scripts?** Should we provide automated download scripts for public datasets?

## ✅ To Do

- [ ] Verify all CVF paper links are working
- [ ] Add missing dataset links
- [ ] Update when pending code releases become available
- [ ] Add performance metrics when available
- [ ] Consider adding audio/video specific sections
