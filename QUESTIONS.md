# 📋 Questions for Expanding Benchmark Table

## Cross-Dataset Performance (AUC %)

To make the benchmark table more comprehensive, I need performance metrics from papers. Here's what I need:

## 🔍 What I Need From You

### 1. Do you have your own survey paper with benchmark results?
If yes, please share the PDF or the table of results from your paper.

### 2. Which datasets should I include?
Currently I have: `FF++ (c23)`, `Celeb-DF`, `DFDC`

**Other popular datasets to add:**
- [ ] FF++ (c40) - raw/high compression
- [ ] DeeperForensics-1.0
- [ ] DFDC Preview
- [ ] WildDeepfake
- [ ] FaceShifter
- [ ] Celeb-DF v1/v2

**Which ones do you want?**
